A 6'3&quot; 185-lb guard, Leonard played high school basketball at Terre Haute Gerstmeyer High School, where he excelled as a tennis player, as well.  He played collegiate basketball at [[Indiana University]], and was selected with the first pick of the second round of the [[1954 NBA Draft]].  He spent most of his seven-year professional playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] (four years in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], and one year following the team's move to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]), followed by two years with the [[Washington Wizards|Chicago Packers/Zephyrs]]).  In his final season as a player, he also [[player-coach|coached]] the Zephyrs.  The next year, the team moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]; Leonard coached them for one more year.  In 1969, Leonard became the coach of the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Indiana Pacers]], a position he held for nearly 12 years &amp;ndash; the last four after the franchise moved to the [[NBA]]. Leonard led the Pacers to three ABA championships before the league's merger with the NBA.  Leonard returned to the Pacers in 1985 as a color commentator, first for television (WXIN-59 &amp; WTTV-4), then on radio, where he remains alongside Mark Boyle on [[WIBC (FM)|WIBC]] 1070-AM.  His trademark phrase (for successful three-point shots) is &quot;Boom, Baby!&quot;  == External links == *[http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/leonasl01c.html Basketball-Reference.com: Slick Leonard (as coach)]                *[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leonasl01.html Basketball-Reference.com: Slick Leonard (as player)] *[http://www.remembertheaba.com/TributeMaterial/Leonard.html Remember the ABA: Slick Leonard]  {{start box}} {{succession box | title=[[Washington Wizards|Chicago Zephyrs/Baltimore Bullets]] Head Coach | before=[[Jack McMahon]]| years=1963&amp;ndash;1964| after= [[Buddy Jeannette]] }} {{succession box | title=[[Indiana Pacers]] Head Coach | before=[[Larry Staverman]]| years=1968&amp;ndash;1980| after= [[Jack McKinney (basketball)|Jack McKinney]] }} {{end box}}  {{1954 NBA Draft}} {{WizardsCoach}} {{Indiana Pacers}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Leonard, Slick}} [[Category:Living people]] [[Category:1932 births]] [[Category:American basketball coaches]] [[Category:American basketball players]] [[Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball players]] [[Category:Baltimore Bullets (1947-1955) draft picks]] [[Category:Minneapolis Lakers players]] [[Category:Los Angeles Lakers players]] [[Category:Chicago Packers expansion draft picks]] [[Category:Chicago Packers players]] [[Category:Chicago Zephyrs players]] [[Category:Chicago Zephyrs coaches]] [[Category:Baltimore Bullets coaches]] [[Category:Indiana Pacers coaches]] [[Category:Player-coaches]] [[Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters]]  [[fr:Bob Leonard]]</text>     </revision>
